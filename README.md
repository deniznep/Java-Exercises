# Java-Exercises

Playing around / memorizing random Java snippets and functions.

I haven't been doing any coding for over a year and am using this repository as a place to keep various basic/intermediate Java exercises that I can always refer back to.

There are also simple programs and utility functions I created for the sake of practice.

CHEERS >>> ;)
